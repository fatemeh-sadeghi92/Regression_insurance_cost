# Regression_insurance_cost
this repo is written with the aim of finding the optimal model of the influencing variables on the cost of insurance.
data sets is collected from kaggle and include 6 variables( age, sex, BMI, children, smoker, region) and a response variabel(charges)
First, descriptive statistics have been used to identify the variables and how they affect the response variable. using Histogram, bar chart, scatter plot, box plot to find the influenc varibel
second, using ANOVA to determine the precise and numerical value of the effect of each variable on the response variable
Then the best regression model is built with the influencing variables and the next level is forming the RSM based on the regression model
